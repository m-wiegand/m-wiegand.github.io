<section>
    <h2 id="bio">Welcome</h2>

<p>I’m a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/en/web/econ">Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)</a> in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>I work on questions in Labor, Public and Urban Economics.
My research examines how local economic conditions influence the optimal design of labor market policies and workers&rsquo; employment trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>I am on the 2025/2026 job market.</strong></p>

    <span id="pubabs_1" style="display:none;">: This paper studies how local economic conditions shape the optimal design of unemployment benefits across space. I develop a theoretical framework that characterizes the insurance value and fiscal costs of unemployment benefits across locations as a function of (i) local prices, (ii) behavioral responses in unemployment duration and (iii) distortions to location choice. I estimate the fiscal costs of the unemployment duration and migration responses using novel quasi-experimental variation from Germany&#39;s Hartz IV reform, which tied benefit levels to local rents for long-term unemployed individuals. Unemployment durations respond similarly to benefit changes in high- and low-price locations. However, higher benefits in expensive regions attract jobseekers, raising fiscal costs. My findings imply that indexing unemployment benefits to local prices makes benefits excessively generous in high-price locations, and that redistribution towards regions with lower prices yields sizable welfare gains.

    <span id="pubabs_2" style="display:none;">: We document substantial rent gaps between &#34;market&#34; rents and  households&#39; actual rent. For instance, households who have been in the same unit for 15 years pay about 30 percent less than households who rent a unit for the first time in the same county and type of housing. This rent gap is larger in high growth cities. We decompose the rental gap between the regulatory gap -- the gap that originates from limitations in within tenure rent growth -- and the residual gap. We show that the regulatory gap accounts for only slightly more than 50\% of the actual gap. This evidence suggests that frictions other than existing regulation likely give incumbents&#39; an advantage in the rental market, something that, we argue, is inconsistent with landlord market power. We embed these forces in an overlapping generations model, which we estimate using German data, to study how much frictions in the rental market limit labor mobility, and how much this, in turn, explains why housing affordability is a problem in high growth cities.

  Stepping Stones or Dead Ends? How Geography Shapes the Effects of Low-Skill Employment

    <span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: Starting a career in low-skill employment has been associated with persistently worse labor market outcomes. Yet, such jobs are often concentrated in urban areas, which tend to offer substantial long-run advantages for workers. This paper examines whether the long-run effects of starting a career in low-skill employment differ across locations. We study the case of Spain’s tourism sector—a major employer of young workers that spans both urban and rural areas—to explore how geography shapes the career consequences of low-skill work. Using newly digitized data on tourist flows over forty years, we exploit variation in exposure to tourist demand across regions and graduation cohorts to measure the long-run effects of graduating in a tourist boom. Ten years after graduation, we find that workers exposed to tourist demand (i) are more likely to work in touristic sectors; (ii) have lower earnings; and (iii) are less likely to have attained higher education. Crucially, we also find that local tourism booms attract young workers through migration. Going forward, we will study whether the long-run effects of early-career employment in a low-skilled sector such as tourism differ across local labor markets.
